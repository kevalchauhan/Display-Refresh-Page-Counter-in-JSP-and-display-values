#  Display Refresh Page Counter in JSP and display values

Here is , Advance java Pratical that display the number of refresh page count in same page with using jsp functions.
here index.html file directly jump the control to demo.jsp that have jsp tag for increment and display the number of page refresh value .
if we only want to display the output of input tag from index.html then we simple convert demo.jsp to   bindemo.jsp in <form action> tag of index.html 
if we do that then index.html jump us to bindemo.jsp and bindemo.jsp have get parameter method that display the value of input in browser
. her we use session for display the page refresh number so if browser is close then session is discard so the num
of refresh is not display further.

Here we use jsp so in demo.jsp we use a scriptlet to work the counter increment and display the values through out.print and when we use bindemo.jsp for only the display the value from index.html that time we use jsp:usebin,jsp:setProperty andd jsp expression.
